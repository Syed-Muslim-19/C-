These are my all time c++ code on different mathematical problems,logical statements and algorithmic based formulas. I have tried to make the code as simple as possible so any one can understand the logic easily and in a better way. If you still have any problem regarding problem solving you can contact me on my official gmail:

All it started from a "Hello World" to Programming Fundamentals, OOP, DSA etc.
